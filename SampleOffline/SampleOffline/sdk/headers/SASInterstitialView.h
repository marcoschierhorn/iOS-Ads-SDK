/** The SASInterstitialView class provides a wrapper view that displays an ad interstitial to the user.
 
 When the user taps a SASInterstitialView instance, the view triggers an action programmed into the advertisement.
 For example, an advertisement might, present a modal advertisement, show a movie, or launch a third party application (Safari, the App Store, YouTube...).
 Your application is notified by the **SmartAdServerViewDelegate protocol** methods which are called during the ad's lifecycle.
 You can interact with the view by 
 
 - displaying a local **SmartAdServerAd** created by your application : displayThisAd:
 - removing it : dismiss
 
 The delegate of a SASInterstitialView object must adopt the SmartAdServerViewDelegate protocol.
 The protocol methods allow the delegate to be aware of the ad-related events.
 You can use it to handle your app's or the ad's (the SASInterstitialView instance) behavior like adapting your viewController's view size depending on the ad being displayed or not.

/**  The object that acts as the delegate of the receiving ad interstitial view.
 
 The delegate must adopt the SmartAdServerViewDelegate protocol.
 This must be the view controller actually controlling the view displaying the ad, not a view controller just designed to handle the ad logic.
 
 @bug *Important* : the delegate is not retained by the SASInterstitialView instance, so you need to set the ad's delegate to nil before the delegate is killed.
