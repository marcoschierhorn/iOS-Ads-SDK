 The delegate of a SmartAdServerView object must adopt the SmartAdServerViewDelegate protocol.
 
 Many methods of SmartAdServerViewDelegate return the ad view sent by the message.
 The protocol methods allow the delegate to be aware of the ad-related events.
 You can use it to handle your app's or the ad's behavior like adapting your viewController's view size depending on the ad being displayed or not.
