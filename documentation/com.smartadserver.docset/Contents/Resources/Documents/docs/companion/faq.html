<h3>Question 1 : No ad is displayed</h3>


<p>Check the ad&rsquo;s placement (Site ID, Page ID and Format ID), and the url ( <a href="http://mobile.smartadserver.com/call2/pubmj/site">http://mobile.smartadserver.com/call2/pubmj/site</a>_id/page_id/format_id/S/[timestamp]/[target]/[uuid]/[user-agent]?).
Then check the following points :</p>

<ul>
<li>Does it return a JSON ? If not, there is no ad on this placement, you should create an insertion to assign to this placement.</li>
<li>If the creative type is 0, is there an image url for &ldquo;creativeurl&rdquo; and &ldquo;creativelandscapeurl&rdquo; ? If not, you should add a creative to the insertion.</li>
<li>Is the JSON valid ? (paste the JSON in <a href="http://www.jsonlint.com/">http://www.jsonlint.com/)</a>) If not, check that you&rsquo;re not using a deprecated script. If not, it can be caused by a parsing error in an HTML script. You can try to replace all &ldquo;tab&rdquo; characters by spaces in the script using a text editor.</li>
<li>You should debug your app to see if the &ldquo;didFailDownload&rdquo; method is called, because it is possible that you remove the ad at this moment.</li>
<li>Eventually, you should check that you don&rsquo;t remove the ad as you might be calling [myAd removeFromsuperview]; , [myAd dissmissMe]; or [myAd dismiss];. Also check that you don&rsquo;t hide it, or set it&rsquo;s opacity to 0.</li>
</ul>


<br />


<h3>Question 2 : The app crashes after a fast navigation</h3>


<p>It is likely that you set the banner&rsquo;s delegate to an object that is deallocated in the navigation process. You should set the banner&rsquo;s delegate to nil when this object is deallocated.</p>

<br />


<h3>Question 3 : The app crashes with a "EXC_BAD_ACCESS" or "NSInvalidArgumentException" error</h3>


<p>If you have a recent SDK version (V3.0+), this is likely to be a implementation error.
You should have a look at when you call &ldquo;release&rdquo; on a SmartAdServerView instance.</p>

<p>This might be :</p>

<ul>
<li>After you add the SmartAdServerView instance to another view, if you don&rsquo;t keep a reference on it with an instance variable.</li>
<li>In the &ldquo;dealloc&rdquo; method of the object that owns the reference to the SmartAdServerView instance, in case you keep a reference on it with an instance variable.</li>
</ul>


<p>The proper way to get rid of an ad (in case of download failure for example) is :</p>

<ul>
<li>Set the ad&rsquo;s delegate to &ldquo;nil&rdquo; : [myAd setDelegate:nil]; (the reference is not retained, so the delegate could be called after the instance has been destroyed)</li>
<li>Release the ad : [myAd release]</li>
<li>Set the pointer to nil, to be sure that the released object won&rsquo;t be called again : myAd = nil; (not necessary if you released your instance with self.myAd = nil;)</li>
</ul>


<br />


<h3>Question 4 : My interstitial is displayed under the status bar and has a 20-pixels void at the bottom</h3>


<p>You probably didn&rsquo;t put the right frame for your intertitial. Depending on your application&rsquo;s architecture, you might have to put 0 or 20 for the y origin as the status bar is sometimes not taken into account in the view frame (for example for a UITabBarController&rsquo;s view frame).</p>

<p>We strongly recommend testing with a close button added to the top of the interstitial as it is more obvious when the frame is wrong as the button will be cut and hardly clickable.</p>

<br />


<h3>Question 5 : The close button of my interstitial is cut by the status bar</h3>


<p>See Question 4.</p>

<br />


<h3>Question 6 : The ad is always portrait-oriented (90Â° rotation)</h3>


<p>The ad must be displayed on a UIViewController&rsquo;s view, and not on the application&rsquo;s UIWindow, which doesn&rsquo;t handle the rotation.</p>

<br />


<h3>Question 7 : There is no animation after the ad</h3>


<p>You probably used [myAd removeFromSuperview] or [myAd release] instead of the recommended way : [myAd dismiss].</p>

<br />


<h3>Question 8 : The App crashes because of missing method errorTrace in the JSON framework</h3>


<p>This error is caused by the fact that our SDK makes use of a 3rd party JSON framework called SBJson. We are using an older version of this framework that has this method. The problem is that if a client downloads a newer version of this framework then this method might be missing from the SBJsonParser.m file. The client can resolve this issue easily by modifying there version of the JSON framework and add there own errorTrace method that does nothing but return nil.</p>

<br />


<h3>Question 9 : How long is the ad timeout?</h3>


<p>There is a customizable timeout that can be set when calling the -loadFormatId:pageId:master:target: method. Some ads can implement specific JavaScript code that will tell the SDK to display the ad (if they need to pre-load resources for example). In this case, the SDK is expecting to get progress information (that will be displayed to the user). If the SDK has no progress information for more than 5 seconds, the format will fail in timeout (to prevent infinite loading, and blocking interstitials). This is why the video layer (for example) can timeout after 10 seconds or more.</p>

<br />


<h3>Question 10 : My banner disappears after 10 seconds/My interstitial doesn't disappear, even if I set a "duration" in the interface</h3>


<p>There is an &ldquo;unlimited&rdquo; property for the ad objects, this should be set to YES for an ad that is supposed to stay in place, and to NO for an ad that should disappear after a certain amount of time.</p>

<br />


<h3>Question 11 : Clicks on an ad don&rsquo;t show anything (except if the link redirects to iTunes/YouTube/...)</h3>


<p>This is likely that the delegate of the SmartAdServerView is not the currently displayed UIViewController. In order to display web landing pages, we create a UIViewController, and ask the delegate to display it. For this reason, the delegate must be the current UIViewController on the page.
If you really don&rsquo;t want to do this, you can also send a reference to the current UIViewController with the delegate method : <a href="../../Protocols/SmartAdServerViewDelegate.html#//api/name/viewControllerForSmartAdServerView:">[SmartAdServerViewDelegate viewControllerForSmartAdServerView:]</a>
You must implement it in your delegate and return the current UIViewController, which may be more complicated than having the delegate methods in the current UIViewController (or in a super class from which all view controllers inherit).</p>

<br />


<h3>Question 12 : My interstitial does not appear full screen</h3>


<p>You probably put your interstitial on a parent view that does not take the whole screen. For example, if you have a UITabBarController and you put your interstitial on a UINavigationController inside that UITabBarController, it won&rsquo;t appear full screen. You&rsquo;d have to add it to your UITabBarController.</p>

<br />


<h3>Question 13 : I want to check that the right GPS coordinates are passed to the request</h3>


<p>You can check that the right values are passed by checking the body of the request using Fiddler (Windows) or Charles (Mac OS X).
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/chrishardy/archive/2010/07/18/Inspecting-iPhone-web-requests-with-Charles-on-a-Mac.aspx">Here</a> is how you can use Charles to inspect iPhone web requests on a Mac.</p>

<br />




<h3>Question 14 : The SDK makes my video player unable to play a video, other applications videos, and YouTube videos</h3>


<p>For SDK Video formats, you must be sure that you understand the provided video sample project. This bug is solved by setting the useApplicationAudioSession property of your MPMoviePlayerController instances to &ldquo;NO&rdquo;.</p>

<br />


<h3>Question 15 : The prefetch mode doesn't work</h3>


<p>Try to set the static method enabledLogging of the SmartAdServerView class as follows in your app delegate :</p>

<pre><code>[SmartAdServerView enabledLogging];
</code></pre>
